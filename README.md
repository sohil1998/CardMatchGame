# CardMatchGame
Challenge your memory as you uncover matching pairs and enjoy.

What the project does -
This project is a card-matching game. You have to select one card, then choose another card. The code will check if the two cards are the same or not, and so on. Every user move and match are counted and displayed on the top of the game board. Below is the restart button; clicking it will shuffle the cards randomly, restarting the game for you.

How to run the project -
First, clone the project to your machine. Then run yarn install or npm install. After that, execute yarn start and then react-native run-android. The app will run on your emulator or your connected mobile device (if debugging is enabled).
